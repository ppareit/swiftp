Help with translating
=====================
The changes are marked with a + (addition), - (removal) or * (change).
The default file is in SwiFTP/res/values/strings.xml. If you would for instance translated to dutch, you would need to create a new file SwiFTP/res/values-nl/strings.xml , that file should contain the same contents as the default file, but the strings must be translated in dutch. The language codes are available at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php .
Translations are preferable done on github.
