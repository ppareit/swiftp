Thanks for using FTP Server (SwiFTP)! Here are some brief usage instructions. More
information can be found at http://ppareit.github.com/swiftp/.\n\n\
\
This program allows you to run an ftp server on your android device. This means that any
program can access the files on your device while the ftp server is running. For example,
entering \'ftp://...\' in the firefox url bar will allow you to browse the files on your
device from a desktop pc or a laptop.\n\n
\
By default, the user name and password are both \'ftp\', you should change them. You use
this username and password when accessing the server.\n\n
\
There is a configuration option (\"keep phone awake\") that fixes a problem where
file transfers go slow or stop completely when the phone sleeps. If you have this
problem, check this box and restart the program. Your phone will stay awake as long as
the server is running.\n\n
\
For power and security reasons, it is recommended that the server be stopped after use.\n\n\
\
If something is not working the way you expect it to, please report it to Pieter Pareit
(pieter.pareit@gmail.com).\n\n\
\
The development of this open source program is supported by buying this program through
the google play store. You can follow the development at https://github.com/ppareit/swiftp .
To have an idea on the features that will be implemented, see the issue tracker at
https://github.com/ppareit/swiftp/issues .\n\n
