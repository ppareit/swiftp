Thank you!</string>
<string name="instructions_text">\
Thanks for using SwiFTP! Here are some brief usage instructions. More information can be \
found at http://www.swiftp.org.\n\n\
\
You should have been prompted to enter a username and password when you started SwiFTP \
for the first time. You must use this username and password when accessing the server. \
This information can be changed later by clicking the Setup button from the main screen.\
\n\n\
The global proxy is a way to connect to your device from anywhere on the net. Your \
traffic is routed through some proxy servers in order to avoid firewall and NAT problems. \
If you enable this feature, make sure you have a strong password, because anyone can \
attempt to connect to your device. The global proxy feature can be enabled or disabled \
from the setup screen.\n\n\
\
For power and security reasons, it's recommended that the server be stopped after use.\n\n\
\
If something is not working the way you expect it to, please report it to me at www.swiftp.org.\n\n\
\
Thanks for using SwiFTP, and look for more improvements soon.\n\n\

If you think that this error should not have occurred, it would be very helpful if you \
would email <b>swiftp-devel @ googlegroups.com</b> or visit <b>http://www.swiftp.org</b> 
and report this as a bug (go to the <b>"Issues"</b> \
section).\n\

Thanks very much for your help!\n\
